      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I'm 33 years old and recently moved to Minneapolis from Boston</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I'm originally from CT and moved to Boston for my undergraduate</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I love hiking, campling, biking, playing tennis, crochetting, sewing, making music, and hanging out with my rescue dog Anakin. </p>
      <h1>What is your dream job? </h1>

      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>

      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I created my wedding website this past year and loved every minute of designing it. I used a design site called Wix.com which was easy to use but I wanted to do more than what it allowed. I spent hours working on it and never felt bored which is rare for me so I'm curious if this is something I can do full-time </p>
